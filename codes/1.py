a leading software development firm.
On your first day, you're given a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle.
It's not working correctly, though.
Your supervisor mentions there's a small error and challenges you to find and fix it.

# The Code

length = 5
width = 3

# Calculate the area 
area = length * width # Modify this line of code

# Print the result
